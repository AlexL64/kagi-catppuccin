# Catppuccin kagi themes

Here are my Kagi themes based on the [Catppuchin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color palettes.

The themes are still a work in progress.

As I am still trying out Kagi, I can't guarantee that this repository will be updated.

## Installation

1. Copy one of the themes from the [`themes/`](https://github.com/AlexL64/kagi-catppuccin/blob/main/themes/) folder.
2. In Kagi, go to `Settings -> Appearance`, then navigate to `Custom CSS` and click on "**Change**".
3. Paste the theme into the text box and click on "**Save Changes**".
Note: I recommend setting the theme to "**Dark**" in Kagi for the [`Frappé`](https://github.com/AlexL64/kagi-catppuccin/blob/main/themes/frappe.css), [`Macchiato`](https://github.com/AlexL64/kagi-catppuccin/blob/main/themes/macchiato.css), and [`Mocha`](https://github.com/AlexL64/kagi-catppuccin/blob/main/themes/mocha.css) themes, or to "**Light**" for the Latte [`Latte`](https://github.com/AlexL64/kagi-catppuccin/blob/main/themes/latte.css).
